# WASTE AND SECURITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
## 💫Year 2 C ✌️ Rwanda Coding Academy 💫

This project is built to address the lack of systems that help the government provide both security and garbage collecting services.

## Overview

In today’s world, not owning a system that records data in money providing activities like security and garbage collecting  is a risk. You put yourself at risk of corruption and embezzlement. The government would benefit from a system able to track the payments for its different services. We aim to develop an application that would enable them to record every transaction and help pay the companies they hired to provide the service. For eg. If someone wants to pay for security, they can do it through our platform, if they want to pay the garbage collecting companies they can just transfer the money from our platform straight to their bank accounts. They can record every transaction for future use and for insight on the amount they get every time. Through the platform,districts will be able to organize how different governmental services are provided and paid for.
